Experimenting with the Bluetooth BLE devices I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor (mainly the **BluCon**, **Bubble** and **MiaoMiao** transmitters, M5Stack and the Mi Band and Watlaa watches) and trying something new compared to the traditional apps:

* a universal **SwiftUI** application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst;
* an **independent Apple Watch app** connecting directly via Bluetooth;
* scanning the Libre directly via **NFC**;
* using online servers for calibrating just like **Abbottâ€™s algorithm**;
* varying the **reading interval** (the Bubble firmware allows to set it from 1 to 15 minutes while the MiaoMiao one to reduce it to 1 or 3 minutes);
* a detailed **log** to check the traffic from/to the BLE devices and remote servers.

Still too early to decide the final design (but I really like already the evil logo ðŸ˜ˆ), here there are some recent screenshots I tweeted:

The project started as a single script for the iPad Swift Playgrounds and was quickly converted to an app by using a standard Xcode template: it should compile finely without external dependencies just after changing the _Bundle Identifier_ in the _General_ panel and the _Team_ in the _Signing and Capabilities_ tab of Xcode -- Spike users know already very well what that means... ;)

Please refer to the [TODOs list](https://github.com/gui-dos/DiaBLE/blob/master/TODO.md) for the up-to-date status of all the current limitations and known bugs of this prototype.
